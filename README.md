Gaining insights on what could affect student performance using machine learning

## Overview
This project explores high school student performance through a comprehensive analysis of demographic and performance data. The primary goal is to identify key factors that influence academic outcomes. This exploration is anchored in a dataset available on Kaggle, which includes diverse demographic and performance-related variables.

## Structure of the Project
The project is structured into three main components:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** An initial deep dive into the dataset to understand its characteristics and uncover underlying patterns.
2. **Variable Selection:** This phase involves selecting the most impactful variables that influence student performance, based on insights from random forest and xgboost models.
3. **Regression Modeling:** Building and evaluating a regression model to predict student performance. 

## Content of the Notebook
The notebook "Student Variable Selection- Final Model" is a pivotal part of the project, featuring:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Utilizing visualizations and statistical analysis to explore the data.
- **Variable Selection and Feature Engineering:** Employing statistical methods and tree based models to identify significant predictors.
- **Model Building and Evaluation:** Constructing a regression model and assessing its performance.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python:** Primary programming language used for analysis.
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and documentation.

## Key Insights
The analysis yields insights into how demographic factors affect student academic performance, offering valuable information for educators and policymakers.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of data science in understanding educational outcomes. It provides a data-driven perspective on how various factors contribute to student performance, serving as a resource for educational research and decision-making.
